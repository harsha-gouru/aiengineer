# AI Engineer Roadmap 2025

## 1. Core Practical Skills

### Programming Languages
- **Python** (must-have; for ML, data, APIs)
- Java, C++, R, JavaScript (optional, domain-specific)
- Use frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Hugging Face Transformers

### Data Modeling & Engineering
- SQL, NoSQL (MongoDB, DynamoDB)
- Data cleaning, transformation, ETL pipelines
- Big data tools: Spark, Hadoop, Flink, DuckDB

### Machine Learning & Deep Learning
- Supervised/unsupervised learning, evaluation metrics
- Neural networks: CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, LLMs
- Model evaluation: accuracy, F1, RMSE, MAE
- Generative AI: GPT-4, LLaMA, Stable Diffusion
- Reinforcement Learning (for robotics, games)

### Cloud & MLOps
- **GCP, AWS, Azure** (Vertex AI, Sagemaker, Bedrock, Azure ML)
- Deploy models using managed services, serverless, and containers
- CI/CD for ML: MLflow, Kubeflow, Jenkins, GitHub Actions
- Monitoring, logging, rollback, versioning

### Containerization & System Design
- Docker (containerize ML apps)
- Kubernetes (orchestrate scalable AI systems)
- Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, CloudFormation
- Microservices, REST APIs (FastAPI, Flask)

### Security & Privacy
- Data privacy (GDPR, CCPA compliance)
- Differential privacy, multi-party computation, homomorphic encryption
- Secure model deployment (IAM, encrypted storage, model guardrails)

## 2. System Design & Architecture

### Typical AI System Architecture
```
[User/API Request]
    |
[API Gateway / Load Balancer]
    |
[Microservices (FastAPI, Flask)]
    |
[Model Serving Layer (TensorFlow Serving, TorchServe, Vertex AI Endpoint)]
    |
[Data Layer (SQL/NoSQL/BigQuery/S3)]
    |
[Monitoring & Logging (Prometheus, Grafana, Cloud Monitoring)]
```
- Use Docker for each component
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration and auto-scaling
- Use CI/CD for automated retraining, testing, and deployment

### Example: LLM-powered RAG System
- **Frontend**: React or Streamlit
- **Backend**: FastAPI
- **LLM**: Vertex AI, OpenAI API, or Hugging Face model
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone, Weaviate, FAISS
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes on GCP (GKE)
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, GCP Monitoring

### Example: End-to-End ML Pipeline
- **Data ingestion**: Cloud Storage, Pub/Sub
- **Processing**: Dataflow, Spark on Dataproc
- **Training**: Vertex AI custom jobs
- **Deployment**: Vertex AI endpoint, Cloud Run
- **Automation**: Cloud Composer (Airflow), Kubeflow Pipelines

## 3. What’s Expected at Each Level

### Junior AI Engineer
- Implement and fine-tune models using frameworks
- Write clean, tested Python code
- Build and consume REST APIs for ML
- Use cloud ML services for deployment
- Basic Docker, Git, SQL

### Mid-Level AI Engineer
- Design and build scalable data/ML pipelines
- Automate model retraining and deployment (CI/CD)
- Use Kubernetes for orchestration
- Optimize cost and performance
- Implement basic security/privacy

### Senior/Architect
- Architect end-to-end AI systems (multi-cloud, multi-tenant)
- Lead design of scalable, resilient, secure ML platforms
- Integrate monitoring, logging, and alerting
- Drive adoption of MLOps best practices
- Mentor team, review code, enforce standards

## 4. Smart Learning & Portfolio Building

- **Don’t memorize algorithms**: Use pre-built models, focus on integration and deployment
- **Build real projects**: RAG system, AutoML pipeline, multi-tenant SaaS
- **Use your GCP credits**: Practice on real cloud infra
- **Contribute to open source**: MLflow, Kubeflow, Hugging Face
- **Get certified**: Google Professional ML Engineer, AWS ML Specialty

**Key Insight for 2025:**
> AI Engineers are expected to deliver real business value by rapidly building, deploying, and maintaining robust, scalable, and secure AI systems. Mastering system design, cloud, MLOps, and security is more important than memorizing algorithms. Your ability to learn new tools and build practical solutions is your biggest asset.
