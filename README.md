# 🚀 AI Engineering Learning Hub

> A comprehensive repository for mastering AI Engineering and MLOps with a production-first approach

## 📖 About This Repository

This is my personal learning hub for becoming a production-ready AI Engineer, focusing on practical skills that matter in the industry. The repository combines structured learning paths, hands-on projects, and real-world implementations.

### 🎯 Core Philosophy
- **Production > Theory**: Focus on deploying and maintaining AI systems
- **80/20 Rule**: Master the 20% of skills that deliver 80% of value
- **Multi-Cloud Mastery**: Learn AWS, Azure, and GCP simultaneously
- **Free-First Approach**: Maximize free-tier services before using paid credits
